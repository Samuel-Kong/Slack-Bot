# Slack-Bot
A basic Slack bot

So I have previously never used Slack, preferring to use Discord but I thought this would be an interesting project so I made it

I did so following the tutorial by https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/build-first-slack-bot-python.html but used the Slack SDK instead of the Slack Client since that was deprecated

I learned quite a lot from this project such as how Slack functions and how to properly utilise the Slack SDK (I had looked into it but not meddled with it before)
